# 🔍 **Binary Search Performance Checker** 🚀

Welcome to the **Binary Search Performance Checker** project! This tool compares the performance of **Naive Search** and **Binary Search** algorithms on a randomly generated list of numbers.

---

## 📊 **What is This?**

This project allows you to:

1. Compare **Naive Search** (linear search) and **Binary Search** on a random list of numbers.
2. Check the time taken by each algorithm to find a specific number.
3. View which search method is faster and how the performance varies with different list sizes.

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

### 1. **Naive Search**
- It checks each element of the list one-by-one until it finds the target element.
- Time complexity: **O(n)**

### 2. **Binary Search**
- It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to find the target element faster in a sorted list.
- Time complexity: **O(log n)**
